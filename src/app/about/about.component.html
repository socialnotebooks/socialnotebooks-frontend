  </p>

  <p class="about-text">

    With a simple and secure login process, you can use a social key as your unique identifierâ€”just copy, write down, or memorize your key. 
    No usernames, no emailsâ€”just you. Umm, youâ€™re smart enough to figure it out!
  </p>



  <p class="about-text">
    tenX is anonymous, safe, and fast. It leverages one-way encryption to ensure your data is secure. If you come across any feed 
    that violates community guidelines, use the "Report Feed" option, and it will be removed immediately.
